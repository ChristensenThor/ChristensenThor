### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm co-founder of Rig.dev - an application platform for Kubernetes ðŸš¢

With Rig.dev, we empower developers to work in their own environments with elevated application abstractions while still leveraging Kubernetes's reliability, portability, and scalability. Our developer-friendly deployment engine simplifies the process of rolling out, managing, debugging and scaling applications. The platform includes a Dashboard, CLI, and CI/CD pipelines that seamlessly integrate with GitHub Actions.

We are passionate about connecting and engaging with developers and are currently on the lookout for as much feedback as we can possibly get on our newly launched platform.
