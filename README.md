### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm co-founder of Rig.dev - an open-source cloud development platform for Kubernetes ðŸš¢

With Rig.dev we empower developers to work in their own environments with elevated application abstractions, while still leveraging Kubernetes's reliability, portability, and scalability. Our developer-friendly deployment engine simplifies the process of rolling out, managing, debugging and scaling applications. The platform includes a Dashboard, CLI, and CI/CD pipelines that seamlessly integrate with GitHub Actions.

Passionate about connecting and engaging with developers, and are currently on the lookout on as much feedback as we can possible get on our newly launched platform.
